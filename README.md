#Executive summary

# Executive Summary

This project involves predictive modeling for **silica content in iron ore concentrate** based on input ore quality and processing parameters from an iron ore flotation plant. The dataset spans six months of observations, with sensor readings recorded at varying intervals (1 to 180 measurements per hour) across 22 features.

## Objective
The primary goal is to predict the **silica content** in the final ore concentrate to support proactive process adjustments and improve product quality.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Analysis**
   - Initial exploration revealed no missing values but highlighted duplicate entries and a significant 13-day gap in the time series, likely due to plant downtime.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - The dataset was resampled to hourly intervals to align with the target variable (% Silica Concentrate), followed by handling duplicates and gaps.
   - Feature engineering steps were performed to ensure consistency and prepare the data for model training.

3. **Modeling**
   - **Random Forest**: Achieved an initial R² of 0.65. After excluding `% Iron Concentrate`, the R² dropped to 0.05.
   - **LSTM**: Improved performance to an R² of 0.52 after tuning parameters.

4. **Additional Techniques**
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified the most influential variables affecting silica content.
   - **SHAP Analysis**: Interpreted model predictions and provided transparency.
   - **Grid Search**: Optimized hyperparameters for Random Forest and LSTM models to improve performance.

## Conclusion
Both Random Forest and LSTM models demonstrated limited predictive power, likely due to the **low quality of input ore data**. The dataset's accuracy should be validated with plant operators to ensure data reliability. Without accurate input data, achieving substantial improvements in predictive performance is challenging.

## Recommendation
- Improving the quality and granularity of input ore data.
- Exploring alternative features or external factors that may influence silica content.
- Engaging with plant operators to contextualize sensor readings and validate anomalies.

This project demonstrates the application of various data analysis and machine learning techniques, including **Random Forest**, **LSTM**, **feature importance analysis**, **SHAP values**, and **hyperparameter tuning** through **grid search**. These approaches showcase my ability to employ diverse methods to solve complex predictive modeling problems.
